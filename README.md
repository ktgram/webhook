# Telegram-bot templates

This repository contains simple different examples of how to use
the [telegram-bot](https://github.com/vendelieu/telegram-bot) library.

# How to use

All the examples are conveniently located in different branches, so that you can immediately clone the right one and
start working with it.

You can select the master branch where the minimum example project is located, or you can use a suitable one in the
corresponding branch and start using it.

To clone only master branch use this command:

```
git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/vendelieu/telegram-bot_template.git
```

Then replace the word `BOT_TOKEN` with your token in `TgBotApplication.kt`

and just run your first bot with command:

```
./gradlew run
```

If you have any questions, you can see the [api documentation](https://vendelieu.github.io/telegram-bot/) or ask in
the [chat room](https://t.me/vennyTgBot).
